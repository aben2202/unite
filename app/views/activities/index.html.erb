<!-- <div class="instruction-question">How do activities work?</div>
<p>Each activity has a set number of min and max participants that can join.  Users join an activity by first clicking on the activity title in the list below, and then clicking the "JOIN ACTIVITY" button in the activity details page.  Once the min number of participants has been met, the activity becomes real and will actually take place, or as we like to say, "<span class="its-on-text">IT'S ON!</span>".  You can see how many spots remain for an activity by looking at the 'Open' column in the table below.  All activities have a max number of participants, and are on a "first come, first served" basis, so be quick and don't miss your chance to participate in the next big event!</p><br /> -->

<span class="instruction-question">How does it work?</span>"?</span><br />
<p><span class="its-on-text">IT'S ON!</span> is simply an online hub to organize activities with others in your area.  Want to set up a pick-up game of basketball after school or after work? <span class="its-on-text">IT'S ON!</span> is the perfect tool to help you do just that.  All you need to do is subscribe to the feeds (activities) that your're interested in.  Then when a local activity pops up in a feed that you're subscribing to, you'll be notified right away, and if you want in on the fun, you simply click 'Join'.  If enough people join the activity it becomes real and the activity will take place, or as we like to say, <span class="its-on-text">IT'S ON!</span>.  It's that simple.<br />
