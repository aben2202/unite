<div class="instruction-question">How do activities work?</div>
<p>Each activity has a set number of min and max participants that can join.  Users join an activity by clicking on the "JOIN ACTIVITY" button in the activity details page (as seen below).  Once the min number of participants has been met, the activity becomes real and will actually take place, or as we like to say, "<span class="its-on-text">IT'S ON!</span>".  All activities have a max number of participants, and are on a "first come, first served" basis, so be quick and don't miss your chance to participate in the next big event!</p><br />
